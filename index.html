  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>The progressive enhancement perspective shows the importance of content.
    Content is described as the foundation of the three layers; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    These three layers can be seen as a peanut M&M, the peanut is the content (HTML), the 
    chocolate coating is the presentation (CSS), and the candy coating is the client-
    side scripting (JavaScript). Progressive enhancement is important to the modern web 
    because it is the blueprint for building a website.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>I have definetely learned a lot this semester thanks to this class. I learned so much about HTML and CSS that I am still blown away by
     how far I've come. Something I think I can do well now is style a webpage pretty well. Although I still have much to learn with CSS I 
     can now use it to add a simplistic and modern looking style to HTML pages. If I could start over this semester I would practice the CSS 
     I learned in class more outside of class. I still find myself struggling a lot with positioning things and figuring out the best way to 
     achieve a certain layout. I definetely didn't drill in as much of the stuff I learned as I should have, but I'll have much more practice 
     and repitition in the future.
  </p>
  <p>For the final SpaceX project, the major changes I made were adding some jquery click events that reveal text like click more links and faq 
    slide-downs. This final has helped me learn quite a bit about jquery in a very short amount of time. I also tweaked a little bit of my CSS 
    but not anything major because I spent a lot of time on just first draft before moving on to the final version.
